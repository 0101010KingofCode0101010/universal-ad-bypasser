# Universal Ad-Bypasser

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The ultimate companion for your ad-blocker (uBlock Origin, AdGuard). This script is your **second layer of defense**, defeating aggressive anti-adblock scripts with a **dynamically updated, community-powered blocklist.**

---

## ‚ú® NEW in v2.0: Auto-Updating Blocklist!

This script now automatically fetches and caches a massive, professionally maintained list of ad, tracker, and malware domains from the [Steven Black hosts project](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts).

**What this means for you:**
-   **Effortless Power:** You get the blocking power of tens of thousands of rules without manually adding them.
-   **Always Up-to-Date:** The list silently updates itself every 24 hours, keeping you protected from new threats.
-   **Smarter Blocking:** Your browsing is safer and cleaner than ever before.

## ü§î How It Works

Your primary ad-blocker is great for 99% of cases. Universal Ad-Bypasser handles the tough 1% by:
1.  **Fetching Community Lists:** Downloads a comprehensive list of known ad/malware domains.
2.  **Executing First:** Runs before the website's own scripts, getting a critical head start.
3.  **Direct Interception:** Overrides browser functions (`fetch`, `XHR`) to neutralize anti-adblock scripts before they can even run.

It's the intelligence unit that provides critical data to your main army.

## üöÄ Features

-   **‚úÖ Auto-Updating Blocklist:** Stays current with thousands of rules from community sources.
-   **‚úÖ Your Ad-Blocker's Best Friend:** Works perfectly alongside uBlock Origin, AdGuard, etc.
-   **‚úÖ Defeats Aggressive Anti-Adblock:** Neutralizes scripts that complain about your ad-blocker.
-   **‚úÖ Kills Popups & Pop-unders:** Prevents annoying new tabs from opening.
