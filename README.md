# Universal Ad-Bypasser

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The ultimate companion for your ad-blocker. This script combines a massive, auto-updating domain blocklist with precise, keyword-based filtering to defeat even the most aggressive, self-hosted anti-adblock scripts.

---

## ‚ú® NEW in v2.1: The Hybrid Blocking Engine!

This version introduces a powerful **dual-check mechanism**, getting the best of both worlds:

1.  **Precision Keyword Filtering (Your `MANUAL_BLOCKLIST`):**
    *   **How:** Scans the *entire URL* for specific keywords (like `adblock`, `anti-adblock`).
    *   **Why:** This is the "scalpel". It catches tricky, self-hosted scripts (e.g., `domain.com/js/anti-adblock.js`) that broad-spectrum blockers miss. This is what makes it work on sites like `lxmanga`.

2.  **Broad Domain Blocking (The `REMOTE_BLOCKLIST`):**
    *   **How:** Checks the *domain name* against a massive, auto-updating list of tens of thousands of known ad/tracker domains.
    *   **Why:** This is the "shotgun". It provides comprehensive, high-performance blocking of common ad networks.

This hybrid engine ensures maximum compatibility and blocking power, crushing both common ads and site-specific anti-adblock.

## üöÄ Features

-   **‚úÖ Hybrid Blocking Engine:** Catches both broad ad-networks and specific anti-adblock scripts.

-   **‚úÖ Kills Popups & Pop-unders.**
-   **‚úÖ Lightweight & Fast:** Caches the blocklist for instant performance.
