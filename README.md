The ultimate companion for your ad-blocker, now featuring an **Instant-On Interception Engine** to defeat the most aggressive, time-sensitive anti-adblock scripts.

## ‚ú® NEW in v2.2: The Instant-On Interception Engine!

Some websites are tricky. They run an anti-adblock check the *instant* the page starts loading, trying to win the "race" against blocker scripts. Version 2.2 is engineered to win that race, every time.

**How it works:**
1.  **Instant Activation:** The moment the script runs, its core blocking functions (`fetch`, `XHR`) are *immediately* activated. There is zero delay.
2.  **Priority Blocking:** It instantly starts blocking using a small, high-priority list of known anti-adblock "bait" domains and keywords.
3.  **Background Hydration:** While the priority shield is active, the script silently fetches and "hydrates" the massive community blocklist in the background for comprehensive protection.

This new architecture ensures that no anti-adblock script can slip through during the first few milliseconds of page load.

## üöÄ Features

-   **‚úÖ Instant-On Interception Engine:** Wins the race against the fastest anti-adblock scripts.
-   **‚úÖ Hybrid Blocking Power:** Combines a high-priority manual list with a massive, auto-updating community list.
-   **‚úÖ Your Ad-Blocker's Best Friend:** Works perfectly alongside uBlock Origin, AdGuard, etc.
-   **‚úÖ Kills Popups & Pop-unders.**
-   **‚úÖ Lightweight & Fast:** Caches the main blocklist and uses an efficient, instant-on approach.
