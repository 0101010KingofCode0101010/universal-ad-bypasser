The ultimate companion for uBlock Origin. This script defeats anti-adblock by **actively sabotaging detection scripts**, allowing your primary ad-blocker to work undetected.

## The uBlock Origin Problem & The Sabotage Solution

**The Problem:** You have a powerful ad-blocker like uBlock Origin, but some websites *still* detect it. This is because modern anti-adblock doesn't just check for blocked ads; it looks for the *side effects* of uBlock, like failed network requests for "bait" files.

**The Solution: The Sabotage Engine (v2.5)**
This script now acts as a "Special Operations" unit that goes in *before* the main army. It uses a **Honeypot technique** to neutralize the anti-adblock script before it can even run its checks.

-   **It injects a decoy script** before anything else on the page loads.
-   **It defines common ad-related variables** (like `googletag`, `adsbygoogle`) as harmless, empty objects.
-   The anti-adblock script wakes up, sees these variables already exist, and tries to use them.
-   **It fails silently,** completely neutralized before it ever gets a chance to detect uBlock Origin's network-level blocking.

Your userscript provides the stealth, while uBlock Origin provides the firepower.
