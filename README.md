# Universal Ad-Bypasser

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The perfect companion for your ad-blocker (like uBlock Origin or AdGuard). This script acts as a **second layer of defense**, specializing in defeating stubborn websites with aggressive anti-adblock mechanisms.

---

## ü§î How It Works

Your primary ad-blocker (like uBlock Origin) is excellent and handles 99% of ads and trackers using powerful filter lists. However, some websites deploy custom, aggressive scripts to detect and block these extensions.

**Universal Ad-Bypasser fills that 1% gap.** It uses advanced, direct-interception techniques that ad-blocker extensions often can't, such as:
-   Executing *before* the website's own scripts run (`@run-at document-start`).
-   Directly overriding browser functions (`fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `window.open`) to neutralize anti-adblock and tracker scripts before they can even execute.

It's the special forces unit that supports your main army.

## üöÄ Features

-   **‚úÖ Your Ad-Blocker's Best Friend:** Designed to work seamlessly alongside uBlock Origin, AdGuard, and other blockers, without conflicts.
-   **‚úÖ Defeats Aggressive Anti-Adblock:** Neutralizes scripts that detect and complain about your ad-blocker.
-   **‚úÖ Proactive Interception:** Blocks ad/tracker requests before they are made, saving bandwidth and improving privacy.
-   **‚úÖ Kills Popups & Pop-unders:** Prevents annoying new windows and tabs from opening.
-   **‚úÖ Dynamic Content Removal:** Uses `MutationObserver` to find and remove ad elements injected into the page after it loads.
-   **‚úÖ Lightweight & Fast:** Minimal performance impact.
