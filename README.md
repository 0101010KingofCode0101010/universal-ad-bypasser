# Universal Ad-Bypasser

The ultimate ad-blocker companion, re-engineered with a **Stealth Proxy Engine** to be completely undetectable by advanced anti-adblock scripts.

## ‚ú® NEW in v2.3: The Stealth Proxy Engine!

**The Problem:** Modern anti-adblock scripts don't just check if ads are blocked. They check if you've *tampered* with browser functions like `window.fetch`. Previous versions of this script modified these functions directly, leaving a clear footprint that was easy to detect via a `function.toString()` check.

**The Solution:** This version introduces a revolutionary **Proxy-based Interception Engine**.
-   **It wraps the `window` object** in an invisible proxy layer.
-   **It does NOT modify original browser functions.** `window.fetch` remains untouched and passes any integrity check.
-   **It intercepts calls on-the-fly.** When a site's script tries to *use* `window.fetch`, our proxy stealthily hands it a fake, filtered version instead of the real one.

The anti-adblock script is tricked into using our filtered functions, believing they are the original, untampered ones. **This makes the script virtually undetectable.**
